1. Please add code only related to the main process of Electron in the `src/main` directory. Code only related to the rendering process should be added in the `src/renderer` directory. Add code that can be used by both processes in the `src/universal` directory.
2. Please add all cross-process event names in `src/universal/events/constants.ts`.

## i18n

1. Create a language `yml` file under `public/i18n/`, for example `zh-Hans.yml`. Then refer to `zh-CN.yml` or `en.yml` to write language files. Also note that PicList will display the name of the language to the user via `LANG_DISPLAY_LABEL` in the language file.
2. Add a default language to `src/universal/i18n/index.ts`. where `label` is the value of `LANG_DISPLAY_LABEL` in the language file, and `value` is the name of the language file.
3. If you are updating an existing language file, be sure to run `yarn i18n` after the update to ensure that the correct language definition file can be generated.
